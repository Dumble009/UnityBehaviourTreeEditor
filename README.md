Writing routines of characters or enemies is tiresome work...
This Editor Extension relieve you of such painful works!

# Introduction
Writing code of specific behaviour(such as "transform.position += transform.forward;", "animator.SetTrigger("Attack");") is easy. But writing code of abstract behaviour(such as "Chase the player then attack") is difficult.
With this Editor Extension, You can create abstract behaviour of characters without writing redundant "if else if if...".
Abstract behaviours created by this extension don't depend on specific behaviours, so you can attach same abstract behaviour to different characters.
